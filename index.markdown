Welcome to my website!

My name is Juraj Jursa and my website serves as a personal blog of sorts, an outlet for content I generate; Whether that is in a form of an article, a small analysis, or anything else I can think of.

It also serves as a way for me to develop a basic familiarity with web development in general - although this is just a static website hosted on Github and built using Jekyll, it's useful to remind myself of how html and css even look like in a first place.
