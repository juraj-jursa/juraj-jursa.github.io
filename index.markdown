Welcome to my website!

My name is Juraj Jursa and my website serves as a personal blog of sorts, an outlet for content I generate; Whether that is in a form of an article, a small analysis, or anything else I can think of. 

Some of the areas I am intending to cover are personal projects that I work on when time and motivation allow me to. These can be one-off analyses about some specific area of interest of mine at the time such as housing costs, or my experience with woodworking or smart home automation. However, I spend a lot of time thinking about life algorithms and coming up with personalized interfaces through which I filter and parse neverending onslaught of information from all sides. As such, I suspect that this will become a thread throughout things I want to write about.

It also serves as a way for me to develop a basic familiarity with web development in general - although this is just a static website hosted on Github and built using Jekyll, it's useful to remind myself of how html and css even look like since last time I looked at them in my single web design undergraduate course in 2019.
